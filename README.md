# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Project Log
I wanted to try SASS, and here we are! I tried to challenge myself with some best practices too.
I used HTML, SASS and Vanilla JS to make this work, and SASS (Specially nesting) was fascinating.
I give the hamburger menu some simple animation, and unlike my other challenges, i did not hide the images in mobile/desktop versions, instead i change the source of images using and IFEE and if/else condition in mobile and desktop and tried to not use "display:none;" as much as i could.
* If you wanna see the correct mobile design using DevTools in your browser, you should reload the page when change to mobile view to reCall the IFEE functions.

## My Process
For more readability, i had to put some linear gradient under the texts on banners and that was a lil confusing at first, but i found a way using after pseudo class and make it work.
My main goal was to use SASS and get comfy with it, and it was delightful using this tech.

## Note to self
I've got a little tired of Online courses (I'm currently learning VueJS) and i wanted to get away from all the theory, so i did this and imma do some harder challenges in few next days.
As soon as i feel okay, i will continue my learning process (Which is not stopped, i learned a lot building these front end temps).
